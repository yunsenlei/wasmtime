# Title: Multiprocess Wasmtime: Process Isolation for More Secure Wasm Guests

This projectâ€™s goal was to investigate ways to split the Wasmtime Wasm virtual machine into two pieces: a piece that lives with Wasm guest code in one process, and another piece that lives with the embedder (for example, the XQD Compute@Edge daemon) in another process. The idea is that this separation could lead to better security in case of an exploit that allows the Wasm code to escape the sandbox, including Spectre-style exploits. The main work on the project this summer was to find ways to proxy the hostcall interface between processes and update APIs so that direct heap access to the Wasm guest is not required. This presentation will demonstrate a prototype implementation that runs a guest in a separate process while allowing transparent copying of buffers back and forth to hostcalls. The work is a good first pathfinding step toward a full multiprocess feature in Wasmtime and will inform our efforts in the future.
